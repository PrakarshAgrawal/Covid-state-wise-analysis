# Covid-state-wise-analysis
This repository contains my course project Prediction of covid analysis statewise in India. We took data sets of covid vaccination, covid cases in various states and then  use algorithms and distributions to perform analysis.
The main objective of our study is to explore the trend of covid 19 in Indian states and in some metro cities. Most of the prior research has focused on India as a single unit. However, extending the research to the state-level is important as the State governments have played a separate role in the control of Covid. Moreover, analysis at a smaller level will give more accuracy in implementing measures according to need. Through this study, we will try to answer the following questions: 

1. Which states are under adverse conditions and which are under good control?
2. What is the expected number of cases after the end of November? 
3. Which state will get rid of COVID-19 first (i.e., Number of cases < 1)? 
4. When will COVID-19 vanish in India? 
5. Which state has a chance to suffer from another wave and when?
